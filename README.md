# One Textbook A Day
The python script I use for One Textbook A Day

## About The Project
There is an unfortunate paradox when it comes to learning math: we often get recommended textbooks, lectures and videos; but we never get around to actually listening to them.

## Built With
A simple python script.

## Usage
You will need to have python installed. Then in the terminal move to the right directory and run `python math_random.py` and it will output one of the lines in the txt file. If you have any trouble please send me an email.
